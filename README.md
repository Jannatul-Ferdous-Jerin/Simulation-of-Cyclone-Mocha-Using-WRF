In this project, I simulated tropical cyclone 'Mocha' using Weather Reseach and Forecasting (WRF) model and analyzed variour parameters that influence the formation and intensification of tropical cyclone. The model predicted sea level pressure (SLP) and maximum wind speed (MWS) for different phases as well as the track of the cyclone, and these simulated outputs were compared against observed data to evaluate the model's accuracy in forecasting the cyclone's progression and eventual landfall. 

I analyzed the following parameters:
1. Temperature Analysis
2. Mean Sea Level Pressure Analysis
3. Heat and Moisure Flux Analysis
4. Wind Flow Analysis
5.	Vertical Wind Shear Analysis
6.	Low-level vorticity Analysis
7.	Vertical and Horizontal Profile of Relative Humidity Analysis
8.	Rainfall Analysis

I did the following comparison between simulation and observation:
1.	Track Forecast
2.	Mean Sea Level Pressure
3.	Wind Speed

Tools Used: 
Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS)
